# fission-elm-pages-starter

This repo is an adapted version of the [elm-pages-starter](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages-starter) that demonstrates Fission auth and storage.

An upcoming guide will describe how Fission auth and storage work in the app. For now, you can see the initial auth implementation on the `auth` branch.

Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:bgins/fission-elm-pages-starter.git
```

Install and run the dev server

```
cd elm-pages-starter
npm install
npm start
